htaccess python script, Clean URL

I enjoy the clean URL when it looks like http://baligena.com/home/page

However every time I create a new app I have to re-edit/create a htaccess file.  This is too much work and remembering.  Below is a python script for windows and linux that once ran inside the root folder of your site it will create an htaccess file to make that clean URL you always wanted.   

Warning!  You may need to configure apache and php for the htaccess file to work.  Go to http://max-michaels.blogspot.com/2011/07/working-with-htaccess.html for instructions.
